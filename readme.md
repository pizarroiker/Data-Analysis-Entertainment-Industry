# Decision Optimization in the Entertainment Industry: Data Analytics and Process Modeling at Netflix.

## Introduction

In this practice, I have deepened in the theoretical concepts that we have seen in class.

- First, I modeled the business process for deciding whether to produce a series, movie or not. I used UML and BPMN activity diagrams to visually represent this process.

- As a next step, I performed some analysis of the raw data from the Netflix platform. I have analyzed the consumption data of some users and created bar charts to present the information visually and facilitate decision making by executives.

In short, I have created a small information system throughout this subject. I have applied the theoretical knowledge acquired to:

1. Design and build a data warehouse.
2. Manipulate data and perform analytical operations.
3. Develop a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) to support business decision making.
4. It has been an enriching experience to apply the theoretical concepts in a practical context and consolidate my knowledge in the process.
