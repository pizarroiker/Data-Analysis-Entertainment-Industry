# Decision Optimization in the Entertainment Industry: Data Analytics and Process Modeling at Netflix.

## Introduction

In this project, I have deepened in the theoretical concepts related to data analysis and decision making. Throughout this process, I have applied my knowledge to design and build an information system to make informed decisions.

First, I focused on modeling the business process for deciding whether to produce a series, movie or not. I used UML and BPMN activity diagrams to visually represent this process and make it easier to understand. This model is not the one that would finally be applied but it shows what would be the process of selecting a film or series.

As a next step, I performed analysis of the raw data from the Netflix platform. I analyzed the consumption data of some users and created bar charts to present the information visually and facilitate decision making by executives.

In summary, throughout this personal project I have created an information system that integrates data analysis and decision making. I have applied the theoretical knowledge acquired to:

- Design and build a data warehouse.
- Manipulate data and perform analytical operations.
- Develop a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) to support business decision making.

This project has been an opportunity to autonomously apply the theoretical concepts learned and get a more practical view of their application in a business context.
